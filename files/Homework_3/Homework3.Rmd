# Visualization of Match Information & Statistics
In this assignment, we created a shiny app.

Before implementing the application, data is prepared for the operation. (read_matches.R)
```
# Init files----
# 
require(data.table)
require(lubridate)
# read matches info
matches=readRDS('matches.rds')

# Data corrections----
# delete these column
matches$type=NULL
matches$leagueId=NULL

# fix home teams
matches[home=='manchester-city',home:='manchester city']
matches[home=='crystal-palace',home:='crystal palace']
matches[home=='newcastle utd',home:='newcastle']
matches[home=='stoke',home:='stoke city']
matches[home=='west-ham',home:='west ham']
matches[home %in% c('manchester-united','manchester-utd'), home:='manchester united']

# fix away teams
matches[away=='manchester-city',away:='manchester city']
matches[away=='crystal-palace',away:='crystal palace']
matches[away=='newcastle utd',away:='newcastle']
matches[away=='stoke',away:='stoke city']
matches[away=='west-ham',away:='west ham']
matches[away %in% c('manchester-united','manchester-utd'), away:='manchester united']

# remove unknown scores & postponed matches
matches <- matches[!is.na(score)]
matches <- matches[!score=='POSTP.']

# date operations
matches[,timestamp:=as_datetime(date,tz='Turkey')]
matches[,date:=date(timestamp)]


# Data manipulation----
# adding scores separately
matches[,c('score_home','score_away'):=tstrsplit(score,':')]
matches$score_home <- as.numeric(matches$score_home)
matches$score_away <- as.numeric(matches$score_away)
matches[,totalgoals:=(score_home+score_away)]
matches[, winner:=ifelse(score_home>score_away,'home',
                         ifelse(score_home<score_away,'away','draw'))]

matches[,season:=ifelse(month(matches[,date])<7,
                         year(matches[,date]-1),
                         year(matches[,date]))]

seasons <- sort(unique(matches$season))

teams <- sort(unique(c(matches$home,matches$away)))

```

## Part A
At this part user can filter the seasons and teams.
Home team, away team, date of the game and score of the game are shown.

!["Match Information" tab of the Application](MatchInfo.jpg)

## Part B
At this part user can filter the seasons and teams.
Average goals scored and conceded are calculated based on the filtered team and season. The results are plotted with home and away segments.
